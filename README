This module for OTRS 3.0 provides some minor tweaks for the Rich Text Editor.
Right now it does the following:

* Add the Table function to the toolbar
* Add the Full Screen functino to the toolbar
* Restore the context menu for CKEditor

After installing this module you can get the context menu of your browser by using
Ctrl + Right Click (useful for your Firefox spell checker, for instance).

I would say that some of this configuration can also be moved off to SysConfig at some
point.

Requests or contributions are welcome!
